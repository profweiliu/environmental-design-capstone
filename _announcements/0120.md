Welcome to EnD 4993 Environmental Design Capstone in Spring 2026. I am looking forward to meeting you in person on Monday January 26, 2026.

The course [website](https://profweiliu.com/environmental-design-capstone/) will serve as the primary hub for all course information, including the syllabus, schedule, readings, assignments, and announcements. Please make it a habit to check the course website regularly, as it will be the most up-to-date source of information throughout the semester.

We will also use [Canvas](https://canvas.ou.edu/courses/467418) for assignment submissions, feedback, and grading. All information posted on the course website will be synced to Canvas for your reference; you may also access Canvas directly through the course website at your convenience. However, the course website should be considered the primary source for course materials and updates.

Before our first class meeting, please take a few minutes to:

1. Finish the [pre-class survey](https://qualtrics.ou.edu/jfe/form/SV_6PSt9mSOpZSm7BQ) by this Friday, January 23.
1. Look through the readings for this class on the [course website](https://profweiliu.com/environmental-design-capstone/).

Best,

WL

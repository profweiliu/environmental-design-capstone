Due to inclement winter weather conditions, our class will meet via Zoom during our regularly scheduled class time. Please find the **[Zoom Classroom]({{site.baseurl}}/zoom)** from the course website. 

If you have any questions or encounter technical issues, please let me know. 

Stay safe and warm. I will see you tomorrow virtually.

Best,

Dear all, as the quarter ends, I would like to appreciate your effort during the class! We saw lots of great projects and positive feedback in terms of the class. There are some final announcements about the class and maybe future study in data science. 

**Project Final Delivery and All Submissions**: the final deadline for all submissions is December 12 (the last day of this quarter). For the project delivery, [please check the details on class website](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/projects/#final-delivery). 

**Peer Review (within-group)**: I would like you to report how working with your group members went over the course of the quarter. The expectation is that you worked equally with your partner on the final project. If this was not the case, let me know, and I will adjust grades accordingly. [Canvas Assignment Page](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1833875/assignments/10766793). 

**Course Evaluation**: this is a formal university-wide course evaluation. The system will be closed on December 5 (this Friday). Course evaluation is always important to any instructor, and I appreciate your input so we can develop and adjust the course going forward.

**Future Study in Data Science**: this class intends to be an introduction to data science and we briefly cover lots of aspects: programming in R, geospatial data, visualization, regression, machine learning, and large language models. If you are into any of those topics, I recommend studying online and taking classes at UW. [This section lists some UW courses for reference](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#statistics-and-data-science--uw). 

I hope you will have a wonderful winter break, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions in the future. Happy new year and holiday in advance!

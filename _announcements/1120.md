Dear all, 

It's almost the end of this quarter, and I would like to acknowledge everyone's efforts in the class. There are a few announcements about the rest of class:

**Project presentation**: the class on December 3 will be the [project presentation (check details on website)](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/projects/#draft-work-presentation). Each group should prepare a 5-minute overview of your topic and progress. It does not have to be done since you still have 9 days to work on the project after the presentation. Please share (optional) your slides, proposal, or any relevant products before the presentation day on [Ed discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/86258/discussion/7342580).

**Week of Thanksgiving**: the class on both November 24 and 26 will be online [via Zoom](https://washington.zoom.us/j/96078856399). On November 24, we will have Hsuan (Jimmy) Lo (Quantitative UX Researcher, Meta; Doctor in Housing Economics, Harvard University) to discuss affordability and property tax using causal inference. On November 26, it will be an optional online office hour. 

**Lab 7&8**: Lab 7 will be due November 24, and Lab 8 will be due December 3. For all assignments and submissions, the final day to submit is December 12 (the last day of this quarter). Additionally, there is a small typo in the neural network diagram for Lab 8: there is no connection between c and k. I've updated both the page and the RMD.

Dear all, we have finished the sections on data visualization, even we will still do some visualization around data modeling. Starting from next week, we will briefly discuss some machine learning and AI techniques. 

For Lab 6, it is a place for you to use Tableau Worksheet + Dashboard to conduct exploratory data analysis and initial visualization on the final project. Please check [the Lab 6 requirement](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/labs/lab-06#todo-tableau-dashboard-for-project-datasets) and [Final Project](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/projects/). Feel free to talk with me about the topic of your project anytime. Enjoy!

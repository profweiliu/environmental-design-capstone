## Overview
Urban and rural communities alike face increasing challenges related to mobility, safety, and equitable access to opportunity. Aging transportation infrastructure, auto-oriented development patterns, and shifting demographic and economic conditions have intensified the need for more integrated and context-sensitive approaches to corridor design. Multimodal corridors and complete streets have emerged as critical frameworks for rethinking how transportation systems can support community health, environmental sustainability, and long-term economic vitality. As these challenges grow more complex, designers are increasingly called upon to work collaboratively, engage communities directly, and translate interdisciplinary knowledge into actionable, real-world solutions.

This course focuses on the transformation of vehicular-dominated community streets into multimodal corridors and complete streets as critical infrastructure for mobility, public health, and economic vitality. Framed as a studio-based learning experience, the course integrates conceptual foundations, applied design methods, and real-world engagement to bridge planning theory and design practice. 

A central component of the course is a two-day intensive design charrette, a professional practice model commonly used in urban design and planning. Students will work collaboratively in teams during the charrette to synthesize research, stakeholder input, and design strategies into actionable proposals. The charrette will be co-led by the course instructor and nationally renowned architect and urban designer [Victor Dover](https://www.doverkohl.com/vdover), providing students with direct exposure to professional design leadership and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Offered in partnership with the [Institute for Quality Communities (IQC)](https://iqc.ou.edu), the course centers on a real, community-based project in the City of Durant, Oklahoma. By the end of the semester, students will synthesize research, community engagement, and design thinking to produce implementable design recommendations that support mobility, safety, equity, and community vitality.


## Learning Outcomes 
After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain the fundamental principles and professional relevance of multimodal corridors and complete streets, including their roles in mobility, safety, public health, and sustainability.
2. Analyze corridor sites and community contexts through research and community engagement, integrating various factors with particular attention to rural and small-community settings.
3. Translate findings and community input into applied design concepts, developing context-sensitive strategies that respond to identified mobility and access challenges.
4. Develop and communicate actionable design solutions through drawings, diagrams, verbal presentations, and written materials appropriate for professional and community-facing audiences.
5. Collaborate effectively in team-based and charrette-driven design processes, demonstrating interdisciplinary thinking, time-intensive problem solving, and the ability to synthesize diverse inputs into coherent design outcomes.
6. Gain real-world professional experience through applied projects, including working with community partners and external experts, and engaging in collaborative design workflows reflective of contemporary planning and urban design practice.

### Extra Credits (3 Points)
Submit proof of completion of the Student Reflection Survey to receive 3 extra credit points. 

## Grading Scale
**A = 90-100 Points (Excellent).** Work exceeds criteria of quality, creativity, and criticality. Collaboration among teammates, where required, is exemplary. Content exhibits thoroughness and rigor. Craft is extremely high. Project shows exceptional innovation and evolution. <br>
**B = 80-89 Points (Very Good).** Work meets the criteria of quality, creativity, and criticality. Collaboration with teammates, where required, is good. Content exhibits thoroughness and substantiation. Craft is high. Project shows reasonable innovation and evolution. <br>
**C = 70-79 Points (Good/Average).** Work meets the basic requirements of the assignment. Collaboration with teammates is functional. Content is average, perhaps lacking in depth or rigor. Craft is acceptable. Project shows minimal innovation and/or evolution. <br>
**D = 60-69 Points (Below average).** Work has one more major deficit in meeting the assignment. Teamwork is irregular or uncooperative. Craft is unacceptable. Project shows no innovation and/or evolution. <br>
**F = Below 60 Points (Failing).** Work does not meet the minimum requirements of the assignment. <br>

Note: At the University of Oklahoma, letter grades like A–, B+, C+, D+ are not used in official grading; instead, the grades are full letter grades only, such as A, B, C, D, and F. Rounding will apply only to the final cumulative course grade, not to individual assignments or segments. A final grade of 89.0 or higher will be rounded up to 90 and recorded as an A. The same rule applies to other grade cutoffs: 79.0 or higher will be rounded up to 80 (B), 69.0 or higher to 70 (C), and 59.0 or higher to 60 (D). Grades below this threshold will not be rounded in multiple steps (for example, a final grade of 88.7 will remain an 89 and will not be rounded again to 90). This rounding policy is final, and no further adjustments or exceptions will be made. 

## Course Expectations

### Participation and Attendance
Active participation and engagement are essential to the learning objectives of this course. Students are expected to attend class regularly and contribute to discussions and collaborative activities. Students are permitted up to **two (2)** absences over the course of the semester, excluding the design charrette. Each additional absence beyond the allowed two will result in a 1-point deduction from the participation grade per absence. **Participation in the design charrette is mandatory.** Absence from the charrette may result in a significant penalty and may jeopardize successful completion of the course. Any anticipated conflict must be discussed with the instructor in advance.

### Design Progress and Materials
Design Progress sessions are primarily structured as in-class time for creative and collaborative work. Students are expected to come prepared with basic design supplies and tools, such as paper, pens, markers, iPads, or laptops, whichever tools they feel most comfortable using to communicate design ideas. **No prior design experience or specialized skill set is required.** However, students are expected to actively learn and apply design fundamentals throughout the semester and to use computationally aided tools as appropriate to develop and present final project deliverables.

### Collaboration and Professional Conduct
This course incorporates both independent work and group-based collaboration. Students are expected to be **responsible, respectful, and professional** in their interactions with peers, both in the classroom and in group project settings. Project groups will be formed during class in the first week of the semester. All group members are expected to contribute equitably and to communicate proactively throughout the project timeline.

### Communication

All course-related communication should take place through Canvas. For matters that extend beyond the scope of the course, students may contact the instructor via email.

## Course Policies

### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism
The overall goal of this course is your learning. In order to demonstrate that you have reached this goal, the work you turn in needs to be your own. This includes putting written work into your own words and citing your sources, as appropriate to avoid plagiarism. If you work in a group, seek assistance from a tutor, use a resource on campus, and/or use online resources (including AI software), the work you turn in must be your own, demonstrating your own understanding of the material that you have gained through the learning process. 

If you have questions about academic integrity or plagiarism, please ask: my aim is to foster an environment where you can learn and grow, while also maintaining academic honesty and a clear representation of your learning and ideas. Penalties for serious offenses include a zero on the assignment and egregious offenses can even result in expulsion from the university, so it is important to understand expectations.
Plagiarism as defined by the [OU Integrity Office](https://www.ou.edu/integrity/students#OU-and-Integrity) includes:
- Copying words and presenting them as your own writing.
- Copying words, even if you give the source, unless you also indicate that the copied words are a direct quotation
- Copying words and then changing them a little, even if you give the source. 
- Even if you express it in your own words, it is plagiarism to use someone else’s idea as your own.
Visit the [OU Integrity Office](https://www.ou.edu/integrity/students#OU-and-Integrity) for more information on what constitutes plagiarism.

### Generative AI Policy
Generative AI tools may be used in this course as a support for learning, brainstorming, and planning. For example, students may use AI to explore ideas, clarify concepts, test possible approaches to an assignment, or assist with early-stage outlining and problem framing.

All **written submissions** (including essays, reports, reflections, and explanatory text) must be original student work. If Generative AI is used at any stage to assist with brainstorming, outlining, or drafting, its use must be clearly acknowledged, and any AI-assisted content must be properly cited or referenced. Students are responsible for ensuring that all submitted writing reflects their own analysis, voice, and synthesis. All submissions on Canvas will be reviewed using Turnitin, which evaluates both plagiarism and AI-generated content, prior to grading.

For **creative and design-based work**, students are encouraged to develop and communicate ideas through drawings, diagrams, and original visual representations. Generative AI may be used to support or refine design concepts (e.g., visual exploration, iteration, or up-tuning ideas), but it may not replace independent design thinking. If Generative AI is used to generate or modify visual content: (1) students must retain a record of prompts used, and (2) clearly indicate which drawings or graphics include AI-generated content.

Failure to appropriately disclose or cite the use of Generative AI, or any instance of plagiarism (including unacknowledged AI-generated text or imagery), constitutes a violation of academic integrity. Any assignment found to contain improperly cited AI-generated content or plagiarism will receive a grade of ZERO.

### Emergency Protocol 
During an emergency, there are official university [procedures](https://www.ou.edu/campussafety/policy-and-procedures) that will maximize your safety. <br>
Severe Weather: If you receive an OU Alert to seek refuge or hear a tornado siren that signals severe weather.
- Look for severe weather refuge location maps located inside most OU buildings near the entrances.
- Seek refuge inside a building. Do not leave one building to seek shelter in another building that you deem safer. If outside, get into the nearest building. 
- Go to the building’s severe weather refuge location. If you do not know where that is, go to the lowest level possible and seek refuge in an innermost room. Avoid outside doors and windows. 
- Get in, Get Down, Cover Up 
- Wait for official notice to resume normal activities. 
Additional [Weather Safety Information](https://www.ou.edu/campussafety/divisions#management) is available through the Department of Campus Safety.

### The University of Oklahoma Active Threat Guidance 
The University of Oklahoma embraces a Run, Hide, Fight strategy for active threats on campus. This strategy is well known, widely accepted, and proven to save lives. To receive emergency campus alerts, be sure to update your contact information and preferences in the account settings section at [one.ou.edu](one.ou.edu).

**RUN:** Running away from the threat is usually the best option. If it is safe to run, run as far away from the threat as possible. Call 911 when you are in a safe location and let them know from which OU campus you’re calling from and location of active threat.

**HIDE:** If running is not practical, the next best option is to hide. Lock and barricade all doors; turn of all lights; turn down your phone’s volume; search for improvised weapons; hide behind solid objects and walls; and hide yourself completely and stay quiet. Remain in place until law enforcement arrives. Be patient and remain hidden.

**FIGHT:** If you are unable to run or hide, the last best option is to fight. Have one or more improvised weapons with you and be prepared to attack. Attack them when they are least expecting it and hit them where it hurts most: the face (specifically eyes, nose, and ears), the throat, the diaphragm (solar plexus), and the groin.

Please save OUPD’s contact information in your phone.<br>
**NORMAN** campus:  For non-emergencies call (405) 325-1717. For emergencies call (405) 325-1911 or dial 911.<br>
**TULSA** campus:  For non-emergencies call (918) 660-3900. For emergencies call (918) 660-3333 or dial 911.<br>

### Fire Alarm/General Emergency 
If you receive an OU Alert that there is danger inside or near the building, or the fire alarm inside the building activates: <br>
- LEAVE the building. Do not use the elevators.
- KNOW at least two building exits
- ASSIST those that may need help
- PROCEED to the emergency assembly area 
- ONCE safely outside, NOTIFY first responders of anyone that may still be inside building due to mobility issues.
- WAIT for official notice before attempting to re-enter the building.

One of the main goals of this course is to prepare you to apply data analysis and visualization methods and tools to real-world problems in real estate and a broader built environment context. If you are interested in deeper knowledge about data science, this class will also give you a foundation to pursue future work. The final project is your opportunity to put these skills, both covered in the class and any other techniques, into practice.

Students are encouraged to work individually or in teams of up to **three** people. Please sign up with your group information using the Canvas Assignment provided.

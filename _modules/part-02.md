Feb 2
: **Why Multimodal Corridors** <br>
*In this class, students will be introduced the concept of multimodal corridors and to the final project study site. Students will conduct a virtual environmental audit to evaluate existing corridor conditions, including mobility, land use, safety, and surrounding context. Based on this audit, students will develop a concise context summary that identifies key opportunities, constraints, and questions to inform subsequent design work.* <br>

*In this class, students will be introduced to the concept of complete streets and their role in creating safe, accessible, and context-sensitive transportation environments. Students will then be split into groups to discuss their preliminary findings and identify the most compelling issues and challenges affecting the final project site. These discussions will help refine the project focus and inform subsequent design strategies.* <br>

: **From Framework to Design: Trade-offs, Tools, and Context** <br>
*In this class, students will be introduced to the topic “From Framework to Design,” focusing on how multimodal corridor and complete streets principles are translated into context-sensitive design decisions. Students will then have the opportunity to meet virtually with project stakeholders for interviews and guided discussions, using their contextual summaries to ask targets questions and deepen their understanding of local priorities, constraints, and opportunities.* <br>

Feb 23
: **Case Studies and Lessons Learned** <br>
*In this class, students will be introduced to multimodal corridor and complete street case studies presented by the course instructor and by students. Through guided discussion, the class will collectively reflect on the lessons learned from these precedents, focusing on design strategies and outcomes relevant to the final project.* <br>
